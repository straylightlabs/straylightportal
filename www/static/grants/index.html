      <h2>Program Information</h2>
      <BR>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
      The Straylight grant program is a project to help incubate projects from our makers which align with 
      the mission of our community and platform.

      The goals of the program are to:
      <ul>
        <li>Enable a larger # of active projects, through which makers can collaborate and learn from each other</li>            
        <li>Increase accountability for projects to be driven forward and completed</li>
        <li>Increase communication and awareness of projects </li>
        <li>Motivate more contribution to Straylight library and resources</li>
        <li>Demonstrate that we value makers' contributions of time and effort more than money</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <br>

      <H3>Pilot period (AUG - DEC 2018)</H3>
      <p>
      During this time, we will be working closely with makers to help identify and solidify eligible projects in order to 
      maximize the number of active projects possible. During this time, we are explicitly not putting a limit on the number 
      of grants given to eligible projects, and will be working closely with makers to enable as many projects as we can.
      <br><br>
      At the end of this period, we will do more evaluation to determine what the limit on the number of grants we can support
      on an ongoing basis will be, as well as formalizing the criteria for the kinds of projects we want to select and support. 
      </p>
      <p></p>

      <h3>How do the grants work?</h3>
      <p>Once an application is approved, each grant is paid as a lump-sum with the kick-off of the project 
      (email or meeting). <br>
      The grant can be used according to the maker's discretion. However, during the application process, the 
      maker should indicate the kinds of costs they'd use the grant to cover, including but not limited to:
      member dues, project supplies & tools, living expenses, services or learning (ie. attending a learning workshop).
      <br><br>
      If a project requires specialized tools, equipment, or additions to our facilities that can provide Straylight makers with long-term benefit, additional funding can be provided upon request and review.
      </p>
      <br><br><br>
      <h3>Accountability</h3> 
      <p>
      We believe our makers are motivated, responsible and self-driven, so the structure of the program is designed 
      with this in mind. 

      Much of the accountability during the beta period will be via the monthly check-ins, so we can debug 
      potential problems early and often. 
      </p><br><br>
      <h4>Timeline extensions</h4><br>
      <p>
      We acknowledge that projects may take longer than initially expected. While grant projects should largely 
      be completed within the stated time-frame, under extenuating circumstances, the maker should work with their 
      program coordinator to find an extension for their project. 
      <br><br>
      During the extension period they are expected to continue their monthly check-ins and updates.
      </p>

      <br><bR>

      <h4>Incomplete/abandoned projects</h4><br>
      <p>
      One of the explicit goals of this program is to enable our makers to take on riskier projects that they otherwise 
      would not be able to take on. So of course, not every project will result in success. However, there was still a lot to 
      be learned from failing. In this case, the maker should work with their program coordinators to review and post-mortem 
      the project, as well as document any learnings from their projects.    
      <br><br>
      Under extreme circumstances, if a maker truly fails to meet the expectations of their project grant, the 
      makerâ€™s membership status may be re-evaluated.
